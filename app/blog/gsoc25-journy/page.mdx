# My Google Summer of Code 2025 Journey

## How It All Started

For me, Google Summer of Code began around November 2024. My *awesome* seniors from **Point Blank** encouraged us all to start contributing to open source projects and apply for GSoC. Initially, I was lazy and didn’t do anything until January 2025.

## Choosing the Right Organization

If you're applying for GSoC, consider organizations that resonate with your values and interests not just tech stacks or roles. For example, if you're a web developer, don’t limit yourself to HTML/CSS/JS or only frontend projects. Look for organizations working on things you truly care about.

For me, that meant tech for good and climate action. I wanted to work on something that could genuinely make a difference in the world. That’s when I stumbled upon **Open Climate Fix (OCF)**.

I managed to get 3–4 PRs merged before the application deadline. I was primarily a web developer, while OCF focuses heavily on AI/ML. Still, I never thought, *“Wait, I don’t do AI/ML, so I shouldn’t apply.”* Instead, I focused on what I could control: writing an honest proposal and giving it my best shot.

Luckily, in 2025, OCF had one web dev project and I got selected for it :)

The application process was intense. Over 200 people applied to OCF, and only 6 were selected. Some applicants were from top colleges, had stronger resumes, and better experience. But I focused on being consistent and delivering quality contributions.

> Getting that acceptance email in May 2025 was surreal. All those late nights studying geography, learning about clouds and ML models it all paid off.

## The Night I’ll Never Forget

On the day of the GSoC organization announcements, all of us at Point Blank arranged a night out in the college lab 4 cans of Red Bull and a lot of Lays. We just sat down and analyzed the GSoC 2025 org list.

I was happy to see OCF on the list. That night, I made some comments and PRs (Red Bull *does* give wings :P). But just as I was about to sleep at 7:00 AM, my GitHub account got **banned**.

I was like, *what the hell is happening?!* Apparently, because of my hyperactivity that night, GitHub flagged me as a bot. I emailed the maintainers, explained the situation that was actually my first official message to OCF (though I didn’t get a reply 😂).

Still, from getting banned to getting selected for GSoC 2025 it was a complete emotional rollercoaster.

## The Coding Period: Building Cloudcasting UI

In the beginning, I was really worried and underconfident. I kept asking myself *will I be able to complete the project?* But my mentor was super supportive and helpful.

If you ever feel you're not good enough believe me, all of us have been there. The key is to **keep learning**, **keep trying**, and **ask for help** early and often.

One moment I recall vividly I was trying to convert satellite data into COG TIFFs, but the output looked completely wrong. I couldn’t figure out why. I asked my mentor, and Brad passed the code to another mentor for a review and it turned out to be a *freaking calibration value*.

Lesson learned: asking for help isn't a weakness it's a strength and a sign of willingness to learn.

Here’s a sneak peek into what I used to play with during the coding period :)

## What GSoC at OCF Taught Me

To be honest, I didn’t gain a *ton* of coding knowledge but I did learn how to write **code that scales**, is **readable**, **tested**, and **maintainable**.

I learned how to document code clearly, structure projects so others can contribute easily, and how to work with mentors across different time zones. I also learned a bunch of random trivia about London and the UK thanks Brad :P

## Beyond the Code: What I Really Gained from GSoC

While many treat GSoC as just another internship, I realized that its value goes way beyond tasks and stipends (though yes, the stipend helps as a student!).

The technical growth was huge. Working on the **Cloudcasting UI** project pushed me to explore topics I never imagined like geography, cloud patterns, satellite data, and geoprojections.

Even beyond tech, I learned a lot about project management, cross-time-zone communication, and how to pitch and defend ideas in technical discussions. I learned how to balance feature requests with constraints and gained confidence in presenting my work to stakeholders.

> The stipend helps, but the professional network and skills you build during GSoC open doors that stay open long after the program ends.

## To Future GSoC Aspirants

If you're thinking about applying for GSoC **do it**.

Not just for your resume or the stipend, but for the growth. It's truly one of the most transformative experiences you can have as a developer.

Start early. Pick orgs whose **missions** align with your values. Contribute meaningfully. Ask questions. Share ideas. And remember your unique perspective might be exactly what a project needs.

The *“Congratulations, you’ve been selected for GSoC 2025!”* email will make every bit of the journey worth it.

> If you have any questions about GSoC or open source in general, feel free to reach out to me on any of my socials. I’d love to help and have a nice chat about it!
